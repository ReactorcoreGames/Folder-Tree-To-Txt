## Choose Your Version

### 🌐 Web App Version (Recommended)
**Cross-platform • Works on any OS • Modern interface**

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="foldertree to txt screen (3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/534fda03-9183-4eb6-a1c2-e78d16200c38" />

Simply open the HTML file in your browser, select a folder, and instantly get a visual tree structure that you can download as `FolderTree.txt` or copy to clipboard.

**Note:** When you select a folder, your browser may show a security warning like *"Are you sure you want to upload all files from [folder]?"* - Don't worry! **Nothing is uploaded.** Everything happens locally in your browser, and no data leaves your computer. The warning is just a generic browser message because it's using the file selection API.

✅ Works on Windows, Mac, Linux  
✅ Clean, modern interface  
✅ Download or copy to clipboard  
✅ Completely offline - no internet needed  
✅ No data collection or uploads

### 💻 Batch File Version

Place the `.bat` file in your desired folder and run it. A `FolderTree.txt` file will be created instantly in the same location.

✅ Simple double-click operation  
✅ No browser needed  
⚠️ Windows only
